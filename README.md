Generic Sensing Platform for the PEPR AgriFutur project
=======================================================

History
-------

- **Nov-24** We created the GitHub repository for the PEPR AgriFutur project. Check contributions & activities of UPPA team project on the [IoT-Sensing-System web site](https://iotsensingsystem.live-website.com/news-on-pepr-agrifutur). AgriFutur will officially start in Feb. 1st, 2025. Stay tuned!

Quick start
-----------

The [Arduino sketch](https://github.com/CongducPham/PEPR_AgriFutur/tree/main/Arduino/Generic_Simple_Sensor_Node) for the Generic Simple Sensor Node is in the [Arduino folder](https://github.com/CongducPham/PEPR_AgriFutur/tree/main/Arduino). It is based on the code developed for the [PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project](https://intel-irris.eu/) that is now extended and maintained in the context of AgriFutur.

Enjoy!
